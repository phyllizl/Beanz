# BEANZ

BEANZ is a speed clicking + reaction speed game. 

## Description

Ever wondered how fast your reaction is? How many clicks can you make in 20 seconds? Users have to click on green beans (points awarded) while avoiding the red beans (points deducted). Magic beans appear in intervals for just 1 second - if you react fast enough to click on them, bonus points are awarded.
